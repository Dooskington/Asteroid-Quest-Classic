# Asteroid-Quest

A space game made in 31 days during January of 2017. The most recent builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux can be downloaded [here](http://declanhopkins.com/projects/asteroid-quest.html).

I suck at game art, so I've gotten most of the assets from [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/). The rest were scavenged them from various places on the internet, or made by myself with some tinkering.
